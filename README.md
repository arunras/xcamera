# xcamera - Camera placement in realistic scenes
Xcemera is the implementation of set cover algorithms to approximate good camera placements for given environments.
The enviroments are either 2D (floor plan of building) or 3D (3D model of building, eg: from scanning data).
The cameras are either omnidirectional or have a limited angle of visibility.
